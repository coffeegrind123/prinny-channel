 * Matrix channel for Claude Code.
 *
 * A self-contained MCP server that logs into Matrix as a bot, forwards
 * messages from allowlisted senders into the running Claude Code session, and
 * exposes tools for the assistant to answer with. Access control — pairing,
 * allowlists, per-room policy — lives in `<state-dir>/access.json` and is
 * managed by the `/prinny:access` skill.
 *
 * Ported from Anthropic's official Telegram channel plugin
 * (anthropics/claude-plugins-official, Apache-2.0), onto @prinny/bot. The
 * channel protocol, the access model and the permission relay are theirs; the
 * Matrix half, the inline-keyboard permission prompt, history and search are
 * this port's.
