/**
 * A durable outbox for inbound messages.
 *
 * The channel server only exists while a Claude Code session does. Close the
 * session and the bot is not merely idle — it is gone, and anything sent to it
 * meanwhile would be lost. Matrix holds those messages server-side, but a bot
 * ignores everything older than its own startup precisely so a restart does
 * not re-answer old conversations. Without something tracking what has
 * actually been *delivered*, "sent while you were away" and "already handled"
 * are indistinguishable.
 *
 * So every inbound message is written here before it is handed to the session,
 * and removed only once it has been. That ordering is what makes it durable:
 * a crash between receiving and delivering leaves the message queued rather
 * than lost, and the watermark stops an already-delivered message coming back
 * on the next start.
