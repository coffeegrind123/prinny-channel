/**
 * One bot per Matrix ACCOUNT, enforced rather than documented.
 *
 * DUPLICATED DELIBERATELY. The same file exists in
 * qwen3.8-forge/vendor/prinny-channel/server/src/account-lock.ts, which is the
 * pi channel. The two are separate checkouts that cannot import from each
 * other, and the whole point of the lock is that they EXCLUDE each other — so
 * the lock path convention (~/.prinny/account-locks/<sha1(user@hs)>.lock) has
 * to be byte-identical in both. Change one, change the other.
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG, 2026-08-24. Five bots were logged into
 * `@openclaude:struct.ws` at once — four Claude Code channel servers sharing a
 * single state directory (and therefore a single `device_id` and a single
 * `crypto/snapshot.json`) plus one pi channel with its own directory. The
 * account had accumulated seven devices.
 *
 * The visible symptoms were the pairing prompt arriving four times, and
 * `DecryptionError: The sender's device has not sent us the keys for this
 * message` on every inbound message. The cause is the same for both: peers
 * encrypt to the devices they know, and four processes rewriting one Olm
 * account leave the identity keys the sender cached pointing at nothing. There
 * is no repair — the account had to be stripped to one device and re-minted.
 *
 * WHY THE EXISTING GUARD DID NOT CATCH IT. `server.ts` has a single-poller
 * guard whose comment describes this exact failure, and it is keyed on
 * `STATE_DIR/bot.pid`. Two things get past it:
 *
 *   1. It is scoped to ONE state directory. The pi channel and the Claude Code
 *      channel have different directories and the same account, so neither can
 *      see the other. That is the case that produced two live devices.
 *   2. Its failure mode is silent. It reads the pid, shells out to `ps` to
 *      confirm the holder is one of ours, and the whole thing sits inside
 *      `catch {}` before `writeFileSync(PID_FILE, ...)` runs unconditionally.
 *      Any throw — `ps` absent, a permissions error, a truncated pid file —
 *      means the incumbent is never signalled and the newcomer takes the pid
 *      file anyway. And `process.kill(pid, 'SIGTERM')` is asynchronous: it
 *      returns before the incumbent has released anything.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES INSTEAD. The lock is keyed on `user_id@homeserver`, lives in a
 * fixed shared path outside any channel directory, and is taken with `O_EXCL`
 * so acquisition is decided by the filesystem rather than by a read followed by
 * a write. A second bot does not race, does not signal anybody, and does not
 * take over: it fails to acquire and exits with a message naming the holder.
 *
 * `O_EXCL` is the right primitive here and it is not assumed to work — the
 * sibling `file-lock.ts` was written for the `access.json` two-writer race and
 * verified on the 9p mount this stack actually runs on: unlocked, 4 of 16
 * writes survived; locked, 16 of 16.
 *
 * A HELD LOCK IS NOT PROOF OF A LIVE HOLDER. A SIGKILLed bot leaves the file
 * behind, and a lock nobody can clear is worse than the race it prevents. So a
 * stale holder is detected and broken exactly once, with the reason logged.
 *
 * LIVENESS IS NOT INFERRED FROM THE COMMAND LINE. The first version of this
 * file asked `ps` whether the holder's args contained "prinny-channel" — the
 * same heuristic the old pid guard used — and its own test caught the hole: a
 * holder whose argv does not happen to contain that string reads as DEAD, the
 * lock is broken, and a second bot starts. That is the exact failure this file
 * exists to prevent, reintroduced by the check meant to enforce it.
 *
 * The lock records the holder's start time from `/proc/<pid>/stat` field 22
 * instead. It is exact, costs one file read, and settles PID recycling for
 * free: a recycled pid has a different start time. Where `/proc` is
 * unavailable the answer is "cannot tell", and a lock that cannot be PROVED
 * stale is treated as HELD — refusing to start is recoverable and a second bot
 * on one account is not.
